Feature Descriptions
----------------------
You must create an account to use the app.  Once you sign in you can create as many lists as you want and then add notes to those lists.

If you are the owner of a list, you can manage permissions by going to a list page and clicking "permissions" at the bottom.  This will let you add and remove users that are allowed to read, edit, and manage the notes in your list.

In each list, notes are displayed with the most recently edited one first, also showing which user was last to edit it.

The fancy additional JavaScript feature is that a warning pops up if you are looking at a list or updating a note and someone has edited it in the meanwhile.  To test this, open a list in two tabs; add a new note in one tab and then a warning should pop up in the other tab.
